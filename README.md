# Web-Proxy-Server

Project Overview

The Multithreaded Proxy Web Server is a simple yet efficient proxy server implemented in C++ that handles incoming HTTP requests from clients and forwards them to the appropriate target server. The proxy server supports multithreading, which allows it to handle multiple client requests concurrently, making it scalable and capable of processing many requests at once.

This project is designed to demonstrate the basic concepts of network programming, multithreading, and proxy server operation. The server operates on the Windows operating system, and it is built using the Winsock API for socket programming, along with C++ for the server-side logic.

Features

    1. Multithreading: The server can handle multiple client connections concurrently using threads, improving performance for concurrent requests.
    2. Proxy Request Forwarding: The server forwards HTTP requests from clients to target servers, then relays the server's response back to the client.
    3. HTTP Request Handling: It supports basic HTTP request handling, including parsing HTTP headers and forwarding HTTP methods like GET.
    4. Customizable: While basic, the code can be easily extended to add additional functionality, such as caching, authentication, or logging.

Technologies Used

    1. C++: The core programming language used to implement the proxy server.
    2. Winsock API: Used for socket programming to establish network communication between the server, clients, and target servers.
    3. Multithreading: C++ std::thread is used to manage concurrent connections, allowing multiple clients to interact with the server simultaneously.
    4. HTTP: Basic handling of HTTP headers and methods (e.g., GET, POST) is implemented for proxying requests.
    5. Visual Studio Code: Integrated development environment (IDE) used for development on Windows.
    6. MinGW: Compiler used to compile the C++ code into executable binaries.

How It Works

    1. Listening for Connections: The proxy server listens on a specific port (default: 8080) for incoming client connections.
    2. Receiving Requests: Upon receiving a connection, the server reads the HTTP request sent by the client.
    3. Extracting the Target Host: The server parses the Host: header from the HTTP request to determine the target server.
    4. Forwarding the Request: The proxy server creates a new connection to the target server (e.g., example.com) and forwards the client's request.
    5. Relaying the Response: After receiving the server's response, the proxy server sends it back to the client.
    6. Multithreaded Handling: The server uses a separate thread for each client to handle multiple requests concurrently.

Why This Project?

The goal of this project is to learn and demonstrate core concepts of network programming, socket handling, and multithreading in C++. By building a proxy server, I gained hands-on experience with low-level networking and HTTP protocols, which are critical skills for web development and system programming.

Future Enhancements

While this proxy server is functional in its current form, there are several possible improvements:

    1. Caching: Implementing caching to reduce the number of repeated requests to the same resource, improving speed and efficiency.
    2. Load Balancing: Adding load balancing to distribute requests across multiple servers.
    3. HTTPS Support: Extending the proxy server to support encrypted HTTPS traffic.
    4. Logging and Monitoring: Implementing detailed logging to track client requests, responses, and errors.
    5. Authentication: Adding user authentication to restrict access to the proxy server.
